# Platfrogs : The Floating Frog Platformer
By Charlotte Ramiro de Huelbes and Vedaant Kuchhal

## The Big Idea
  In Platfrogs, you play as a small frog with big dreams of taking to the sky- so, with the help of some floating lilypads, you take to the skies to see how high you can go. 
  
  The aim of this project was to create a frog-themed vertical platformer game. We decided to do this type of game because platformers are very nostalgic and familiar to us (having played games like Doodle Jump and Super Mario Bros in our childhoods), and we wanted to look further into how one was programmed. Furthermore, we both think frogs are quite cute and are known for hopping, hence we decided to make them the theme of the game. Finally, another reason why we chose to go with a platformer is because we wanted to gain some familiarity with the PyGame library, and we knew that creating platfromer games would be a great way to explore its features within the scope of a 2 week project.


## Gameplay
 Platfrogs plays like a classic vertical platformer game, where you can use the arrow keys to move side to side and the space bar to jump. This is a high-score chaser wehre the goal is to get as high of a score as possible. A demo of the game can be seen by clicking the image below:
